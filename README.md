## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- Tailwind CSS


### Continued development

After this project. I decided to focus more on the little components like responsive navbars and learn more about responsive design(I will learn bootstrap for grid system) and transition-transformation/animations and use SCSS. Currently I am trying to focus heavily JS and DSA. After couple of months later when i became comfortable with my JS and alghoritmic thinking, I will learn React. After that I will continue to focus more on bigger projects on frontend. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - Tailwind CSS documentation.
